<p>As compared to the chemical based hair dyes, 
    natural herbal dyes are being preferred nowadays. 
    Herbal drugs without any adverse effects are used for healthy hair. 
    70% of human beings above 50 years struggle with the problem of
     balding and graying of hair. Graying starts on the skin of head 
     at about 40 years, starting initially from the temples, followed 
     by beard and chest. People have been using natural dyes since 
     ancient times for the purpose of dyeing carpets, rugs and clothings 
     by the use of roots, stems, barks, leaves, berries and flowers. 
     The need of herbal based natural medicines is increasing fastly due 
     to their natural goodness and lack of side effects. Amla, Bhringraj,
      Henna, Mandara, Reetha, Sariva, Curry leaves and Methi seeds are 
      well-known ayurvedic herbal drugs. Many different extracts from 
      plant were used for the purpose of hair dyeing in Europe and Asia
       before the invention of modern dyes. Use of these chemicals can 
       result in 
       unpleasant side effects, such as skin irritation, allergy and 
       breakage. 
        In India, henna has been used 
       traditionally for colouring palms and hairs. There are so many 
        like Kikar, Bihi, Bhringraj, Patnag, Akhrot, Narra, Jaborandi,
         Jatamansi, Amla, Kuth, Giloe, Behera which are used as a major 
         constituents in hair care preparations mainly meant for dyeing
          hair. Henna has been used traditionally for colouring women's
           bodies during marriage and other social celebrations since
            the times of Bronze Age. It is a part of Islamic and Hindu 
            cultures as a hair coloring and dyeing agent for the purpose 
            of decorating the nails or for the formation of temporary 
            tattoos . In the present era of eco-conservation, the use 
            of natural dyes has been revived and reviewed for the 
            coloration of textiles and food materials. Drugs from the 
            plant sources are easily available, are less expensive, 
            safe, and efficient and rarely have side effects.

    <h3>6.Black Tea</h3>
    
    <p>
        Black tea is rich in plant polyphenols, which are naturally occurring compounds that can act as antioxidants. Since black tea doesn't contain a developer, it cannot penetrate the hair shaft and permanently change its color. Any darkening effects you get from using black tea to color your hair will only be temporary.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        If you're a blonde, don't expect to have black hair after using tea to dye hair. Black tea also will not drastically change the color of your hair. You can achieve a more dramatic effect by leaving the tea on your hair for a longer period of time, or by repeatedly dyeing hair with tea.

<p>A cup of brewed coffee can do more than just give you a caffeine boost. It can also help dye your hair a shade or two darker, and may even cover up some gray hair.
</p> <p>Coffee wonâ€™t provide a drastic change to your hair, and it wonâ€™t last for long. But if you need a quick and affordable boost, itâ€™s a good option to try.

<h3>6.Tea</h3>
<img src="img/black tea oil.jfif" alt="">
<p>
    Now that youâ€™ve learned how black tea hair dye works and its benefits, learn how to dye hair with tea:
</p>

<p>
    Always do a skin test of any new hair dye or at-home beauty recipe before applying it to your hair and scalp. If you have sensitivities or allergies to the ingredients, don't use them. Repeating the dyeing process will give you darker, more intense results.
</p>

    <li>Brew some strong tea using 3-5 teabags of black tea per one cup of water. For additional darkening, add some dried sage to the mixture. </li>
    <li>Allow the tea to cool, then apply the tea to dry hair using a hair dye applicator bottle.</li> 
        <li>Let the tea sit in your hair for at least an hour. For more intense results, put on a shower cap and leave the tea in your hair overnight.</li>
        <li>Rinse out hair thoroughly, then apply a lightweight nourishing conditioner like Viviscal Gorgeous Growth Densifying Conditioner</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>7.Hibiscus</h3>

<p>
    Hibiscus oil benefits hair by improving blood circulation on the scalp and in the hair follicles. It can be used thrice a week to reap maximum benefits.
</p>
<p>
    We can use hibiscus and amla masks to strengthen our hair follicles and maintaining scalp health. For this mask, mix hihbiscus powder and Amla powder in equal amounts in water to make a smooth paste. Keep it for about 30 minutes and rinse it off with a mild shampoo.
</p>


<h4>Use Hibiscus Oil for Hair</h4>

    <li>Take a few leaves and flowers, around 8-10, and grind them into a fine paste.</li>
        <li>Heat coconut oil and add the paste to it.</li> 
        <li>Heat the mixture.</li>
        <li>Let it cool down.</li>
